This program will read the following input files from this folder:

Input1.txt
A text file containing a list of double-quoted string literals, one on each line. The only escape sequences used are \\ (which represents a single backslash), \" (which represents a lone double-quote character), and \x plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).
Example:
"qxfcsmh"
"byc\x9dyxuafof\\\xa6uf\\axfozomj\\olh\x6a"
"wzntebpxnnt\"vqndz\"i\x47vvjqo\""
""
"aae\x60arr"
